			<h3 class="description">The Spritz Clock is a device consisting of an Node-MCU ESP32, motor, and spray bottle. A Node-MCU is an Arduino-like microcontroller that can connect to Wi-Fi. The Spritz-Clock uses this ability to allow the user (Aden) to set the time she wants to wake up and be sprayed in the face by lukewarm water directly on the internet. This revolutionary functionality means that Aden can set an alarm on the Spritz Clock just as easily as she can on her phone, except she can set up the time on her phone or laptop <i>and</i> see this awesome website every time.</h3>
